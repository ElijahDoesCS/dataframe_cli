# Fat Data Dataframe CLI
## A minimalistic CLI for statistical operations on structured DSV files
    - Supports:
        - Mean
        - Median
        - Mode
        - Max
        - Min
        - Standard Deviation
        - Input range selection
        - 
### Implemented with C library for operation on arbitrarily sized data types
- Bash script runs the python and C library together
- Input sanitization implemented through shared library
- C matrix passed to the marshaller that schedules arithmetic operations
    - Arithmetic operations performed through the "fat data" arithmetic library
### Uses python for command line interpretation and data result visualization
- 
 Bash script compiles with shared library to arithmetic operation
